This solution has been prepared as a tecnnical assignment to demonstrate how a basic aggregator could work as part of a .NET service.

Enviroment variables can be set to control the speed at which aggregated reports are created and their locations, these are:

- Report:Path _An absolute path should be provided e.g. /var/log/reports/_
- Service:Delay _Provide a timestamp in HH:mm:ss format_
